This is a fan game (so i couldn't publish it for obvoius copyright reasons) of final fantasy created by me some years ago (no AI used since it wasn't a thing at that time), if you are interested in the build to play it contact me:

The team to challenge the final boss can be composed of 1 to 3 characters of your choice (5 available). Each character has its own skills and unique mechanics. The boss is very hard and will go through 3 phases.

My challenge in this part of the game was to make everything chain smoothly, action after action, while keeping everything enjoyable and original even though it's still a fan game. The sprites and sound tracks are taken from other games but all the animations were made and managed by me to interact with other entities and events and i tried to make everyhting as dynamic as possible inside the limits of a 2D RPG game.

This one instead is the action part of the game with a procedural generated dungeon to make every run different, currency systems, shop, mobs and mini boss to defeat 3 times before reaching the final battle against Sephiroth:

keeping the coherence between all different dungeon pieces while keeping the flexibily and a sufficent "big" dimension of the dungeon was the challenge here. all the mobs and the mini boss have a rng system to choose each time a skill to use from their sets. The currency earned while progressing in the dungeon can be used in the shop or converted to skill unlocking points for the final boss RPG mode.
